# This is the entry point for your game playing agent. Currently the agent
# simply spawns a token at the centre of the board if playing as RED, and
# spreads a token at the centre of the board if playing as BLUE. This is
# intended to serve as an example of how to use the referee API -- obviously
# this is not a valid strategy for actually playing the game!
